## Introduction:
**snapinsight** is a minimalistic web-based tool designed to help photographers enhance their composition and editing skills. Users can upload a photo, and the platform provides an instant evaluation based on key photography fundamentals such as exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and color balance. Each parameter is scored on a scale of 0-100, with a visual representation of strengths and areas for improvement. The project focuses on simplicity, usability, and an intuitive user experience, making it an accessible tool for photographers of all skill levels.
